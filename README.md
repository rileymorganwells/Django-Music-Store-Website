# Django-Music-Store-Website
This semester, in my enterprise application development class, we've been using the Python web development framework Django to create a music store website. Specifically, we've used our professor's application Django-Mako-Plus (DMP), that combines Django with the Mako templating engine. DMP offers the following benefits and more:
<ul>
  <li>Uses the more robust Mako templating engine, rather than Django's traditional built-in templating system</li>
  <li>Allows you to call html pages and views by naming convention, rather than making an entry in urls.py for every page</li>
  <li>Offers automatic url type conversion, which makes it easier to keep urls clean and make less entries in urls.py</li>
  <li>Enables automatic CSS and JavaScript linking based on template names (ex: index.html auto links with index.css & index.js)</li>
</ul>
